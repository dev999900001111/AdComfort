## Description

**AdComfort** is a plugin designed to enhance your YouTube ad viewing experience. It automatically adjusts the ad's volume and screen brightness to reduce stress and discomfort during viewing.

   Prevents ads from suddenly playing at high volumes. The volume of the ads is automatically adjusted to a predefined level, allowing for a comfortable viewing experience.
